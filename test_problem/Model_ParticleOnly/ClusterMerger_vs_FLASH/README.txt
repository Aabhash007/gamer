   ** Cluster merger test vs. FLASH **
   ***********************************

Procedure to run the test problem:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute the script "Copy.sh" to copy files to their corresponding
   directories 

2. Compile GAMER by typing "make" in the directory "GAMER/src"
   ("make clean" first if the program has been compiled previously)

3. Run GAMER by executing the file "Dizzy" in the directory "GAMER/bin/run"


Note:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Mimic the simulation set-up of FLASH provided by John ZuHone
